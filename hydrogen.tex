\section{Introduction}
    A hydrogenic atom is one with a nucleus of charge $Z$ and a single electron. 
    Therefore the physics of Hydrogen ($\mathsf{H}$) with $Z = 1$, singly ionised 
    Helium ($\mathsf{He^+}$) with $Z = 2$, doubly ionised Lithium ($\mathsf{Li^{++}}$) 
    and so forth, is essentially the same. The quantum mechanics of the Hydrogen atom 
    is applicable to other atoms which only have a single electron. A study of the
    spectrum of hydrogen was one of the earliests tests of quantum mechanics.

\section{The Schr\"odinger Equation}

    \subsection{Energy Levels}
    A hydrogenic atom can be thought of as an electron with charge ($-e$) moving around
    the spherically symmetric Coulomb potential of the nucleus which has charge $Z$.
    The Hamiltonian for this atomic system can then be written down as
    \begin{displaymath}
        H = \frac{\bf{p}^2}{2\mu} - \frac{Ze^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}.
    \end{displaymath}
    where the first term corresponds to the kinetic energy of the electron, and
    the second term corresponds to the Coulombic attraction between the electron and 
    the nucleus. The momentum of the electron is $\bf{p}$, $Z$ is the number of protons
    in the nucleus, $r$ is the distance between the electron and the nucleus, $e$ is
    the fundamental electric charge on an electron or proton and $\mu$ is
    the reduced mass of the system given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        \mu = \frac{Mm}{M + m}
    \end{displaymath}
    The problem reduces to solving the time independent Schr\"odinger equation
    for the above Hamiltonian.
    \begin{displaymath}
    \left[ \frac{{\bf p}^2}{2\mu} - \frac{Ze^2}{4 \pi r}\right] \psi_{nlm} = E_n \psi_{nlm} 
    \end{displaymath}
    Solving for this equation gives the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms $E_n$, and 
    and corresponding wavefunctions $\psi_{nlm}$. The energy levels only depend on the
    principle quantum number $n$, whereas the wavefunctions also depend on the 
    orbital angular momentum quantum number $l$ ($l = 0, 1, ... n - 1$) and 
    magnetic quantum number $m$ ($m = -l, -l + 1, ... , +l - 1, +l$).
    The wavefunctions of hydrogenic atoms are given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        \psi_{nlm}({\bf r}) = \psi_{nlm}(r,\theta,\phi)
                           = R_{nl}(r) Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)
    \end{displaymath}
    where $R_{nl}(r)$ are the radial wavefunctions and $Y_{lm}(\theta, \phi)$ are
    spherical harmonics. The corresponding energy levels of hydrogenic atoms are
    given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        E_n = - \frac{1}{2} \mu c^2 \frac{Z^2 \alpha^2}{n^2}
    \end{displaymath}
    where $\alpha$ is the fine structure constant 
    ($ \alpha = e^2 / (4 \pi \epsilon_0 \hbar c) $).
    Since the energy levels depend only on the principle quantum number $n$, we see
    that the energy levels are degenerate for different values of $l$ and $m$ at a 
    given value of $n$.
    The diagram below shows the energy levels for the case when $Z = 1$ (Hydrogen).
    The degeneracy in $l$ can be seen for the different values of $n$.
    The energy levels shown are known as the gross structure of atomic hydrogen.

    \subsection{Rydberg States}
    A highly excited hydrogenic atom, that is one with a large principal quantum 
    number $n$ is said to be known as a \emph{Rydberg Atom}, or to be in a
    \emph{Rydberg State}.
    The table below compares some properties of a hydrogen atom in a $n=1$ state
    and one in a $n=100$ state.
    \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|p{2.5cm}|c|c|} \hline
       {\bf Quantity} & $\mathbf{n = 1}$ & $\mathbf{n = 100}$ \\ \hline \hline
       Radius of Bohr Orbit (in m) &  $5.3 \times 10^{-11}$ & $5.3 \times 10^{-7}$ \\ \hline
       Binding Energy $|E_n|$ (in $eV$)  &  $-13.6$ & $1.36 \times 10^{-3}$ \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \end{center}
    The Rydberg Atom with $n = 100$, is of an extremely large size -- approximately the size
    of a simple bacteria. However, such an atom has a very small ionisation energy and hence
    the electron is very weakly bound.

    \subsection{Hydrogenic Spectrum}
    The diagram below shows the spectrum of atomic hydrogen as predicted by the
    Bohr model of the atom and by Schr\"odinger's equation. As can be seen there
    are a number of series of spectral lines -- Lyman, Balmer, Paschen and Brackett.
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=7cm]{spectrum.eps}
    \end{center}
    The hydrogen series appear close together in the electromagnetic spectrum.
    For example, the Lyman Series is in the Ultra-Violet (UV) Region, the Balmer
    series is in the Visible-UV region and the Paschen, Brackett and Pfund series
    are in the Infra-Red (IR) Region.

    \subsubsection{The Lyman Series -- Ultra Violet Region}

        Ly$_{\beta}$      &   1026    \\ 
        Ly$_{\gamma}$     &   972.5   \\
        Ly$_{\delta}$    &   949.7   \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    \subsubsection{The Balmer Series -- Visible-Ultra Violet Region}
    \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{cc} \hline
        Spectral Line & Wavelength (Angstroms) \\ \hline \hline
        H$_{\alpha}$     &   6563    \\ 
        H$_{\beta}$      &   4861    \\ 
        H$_{\gamma}$     &   4340   \\ \hline
        \end{tabular}
    \end{center}

    hydrogen. It shows the positions of the spectral lines in the electromagnetic
    spectrum.

\section{Fine Structure}
    Although the energy levels for hydrogenic atoms shown above agree qualitatively with
    experiment, very precise measurements of the hydrogen spectrum reveal the existence 
    a finer structure which can not be explained with the Hamiltonian used above.
    Experiments reveals that some of the energy levels are split into many smaller levels
    and therefore many of the degeneracies are lifted.

    The fine structure of the energy levels of hydrogenic atoms are due to relativistic
    effects and the spin of the electron which were not taken into account in the previous
    section. We can obtain an estimate on how much the energy levels are shifted, by 
    using perturbation theory if we assume the the relativistic and spin effects are 
    small. We can treat the Hamiltonian, energy eigenfunctions and energy levels as
    the unperturbed case and use first order perturbation theory for the perturbing
    components of the Hamiltonian. The Schr\"odinger equation is then of the following
    form
    \begin{displaymath}
        \left[ H_0 + H'_1 + H'_2 + H'_3 \right] \psi_{nlm} = E \psi_{nlm}
    \end{displaymath}
    where $H_0$ corresponds to the unperturbed Hamiltonian used in the previous section,
    and $H'_1$, $H'_2$ and $H'_3$ correspond to small perturbations involving relativistic
    corrections to the kinetic energy, the effect of spin-orbit coupling and the Darwin
    interaction. These three perturbations are described individually below.
    The process then involves determining the shift in energy to first order for 
    each of the perturbing terms in the Hamiltonian. The unperturbed Schr\"odinger 
    equation needs to be slightly modified in order to treat perturbing Hamiltonians
    which take the spin of the electron into account. The modified `unperturbed`
    equation is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        H_0 \psi_{nlm_l m_s }^{(0)} = E_{n}^{(0)} = \psi_{nlm_l m_s}^{(0)} 
    \end{displaymath},
    where $E_{n}^{(0)}$ are the Schr\"odinger energy eigenvalues (with $\mu = m$) and 
    the zero order wave functions $\psi_{nlm_l m_s}^{(0)}$ are modified two component
    wave functions (also known as Pauli wave functions or spin-orbitals) given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        \psi_{nlm_l m_s}^{(0)}(q) = \psi_{nlm_l}^{(0)}({\bf r}) \chi_{\frac{1}{2},m_l}
    \end{displaymath}.
    The parameter $q$ represents the combined spin and space coordinate, and 
    $\chi_{\frac{1}{2},m_l}$ are two component spinors (spin eigenfunctions for
    particle of spin one half). For spin-up ($m_s = +1/2$) and spin-down ($m_s = -1/2$),
    the normalised spinors are denoted by
    \begin{displaymath}
        \chi_+ = \left( \begin{array}{c}
                    1 \\ 0
                 \end{array} \right)
        \hspace{5mm} \mathrm{and} \hspace{5mm}
        \chi_- = \left( \begin{array}{c}
                    0 \\ 1
                 \end{array} \right)
    \end{displaymath}
    Since the unperturbed Hamiltonian does not depend on the spin variable, the
    Pauli wavefunctions are separable in the spin and coordinate variables.
    To describe the state of an electron in a hydrogenic atom, we now have the four
    quantum number $n$, $l$, $m_l$ and $m_s$. As a result of this, each of the
    unperturbed energy levels are $E_n$ are $2n^2$ degenerate.

    Finally the new perturbed energy levels to first order are given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        E = E_{n}^{(0)} + \Delta E'_1 + \Delta E'_2 + \Delta E'_3
    \end{displaymath}
    where $\Delta E'_{(k)}$ is the energy shift resulting from the $k'$th perturbation.
    
	\subsection{Relativistic Correction to the Kinetic Energy}
	\begin{displaymath}
		H'_1 = - \frac{p^4}{8m^3c^2}
	\end{displaymath}
    Since relativistic effects were not taken into account previously, the 
    perturbing Hamiltonian $H'_1$ represents the relativistic correction
    to the kinetic energy of the electron.
    Using first order perturbation theory the energy shift is given by
    \begin{displaymath} 
        \Delta E'_1 = \left \langle nl m_l m_s 
                        \left|
                            \frac{-p^4}{8m^3 c^2} 
                        \right|
                      nl m_l m_s \right \rangle 
    \end{displaymath}
    \begin{displaymath}
        \Delta E'_1 = -E_n \frac{Z^2 \alpha^2}{n^2} 
                        \left[ \frac{3}{4}  - \frac{n}{l + \frac{1}{2}} \right]
    \end{displaymath}

	\subsection{Spin Orbit Interaction}
	\begin{displaymath}
		H'_2 = \frac{1}{2m^2c^2} \frac{1}{r} \frac{dV}{dr} {\bf L} \cdot {\bf S} 
	\end{displaymath}
    This perturbation corresponds to the shift in the energy as a result of the interaction
    between the internal spin of the electron and it's orbital angular momentum as it
    orbits the nucleus. Since the potential $V(r) = -Ze^2/(4 \pi \epsilon_0 r)$ for
    a hydrogenic atom, the perturbing Hamiltonian becomes
    \begin{displaymath}
        H'_2 = \frac{1}{2m^2c^2} \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi \epsilon_0 r^3} {\bf L} \cdot {\bf S}
    \end{displaymath}
    The energy shift for this perturbing Hamiltonian using first order perturbation theory is
    \begin{displaymath}
        \Delta E'_2 = -E_n \frac{Z^2 \alpha^2}{2nl(l + \frac{1}{2})(l + 1)}
        \left\{
            \begin{array}{ll}
                l       \mbox{,} &  j = l + \frac{1}{2} \\
                -l - 1  \mbox{,} &  j = l - \frac{1}{2}
            \end{array}
        \right.
    \end{displaymath}

	\subsection{Darwin Interaction}
	\begin{displaymath}
		H'_3 = \frac{\pi\hbar^2}{2m^2c^2} \left( \frac{Ze^2}{4\pi\epsilon_0} \right) \delta(\bf{r})
	\end{displaymath}
    The Darwin term does not act on the spin variable and only applies when
    the orbital angular moment is zero ($l=0$).
    The shift energy from the Darwin term is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        \begin{array}{ll}
        \Delta E'_3 = -E_n \frac{Z^2 \alpha^2}{n} , & l = 0
        \end{array}
    \end{displaymath}

    \subsection{Fine Structure Energy Levels to First Order}
    Based on the energy levels obtained for hydrogenic atoms from the Schr\"odinger equation,
    and the energy shifts obtained from the three perturbation when relativistic and
    spin effects are taken into account we get
    \begin{displaymath}
        E_{nj} = E_n + \Delta E'_1 + \Delta E'_2 + \Delta E'_3.
    \end{displaymath}
    Now subtracting from the binding energy $E = mc^2 - E_{nj}$ 
    \begin{displaymath}
        E = mc^2 \left[ 1 - \frac{(Z \alpha)^2}{2n^2} - \frac{(Z \alpha)^4}{2n^3} 
                        \left(
                            \frac{n}{j + \frac{1}{2}} - \frac{3}{4}
                        \right)
                    \right] .
    \end{displaymath}
    This result is valid if the perturbation is small, and therefore it begins to break down
    for hydrogenic atoms with large atomic numbers $Z$.

    \subsection{The Dirac Equation}
    The equation which provides the correct energy eigenvalues and eigenstates for
    the fine structure of hydrogenic atoms is the Dirac equation, shown below for a
    Hydrogenic atom,
    \begin{displaymath}
        \left[ c \mathbf{\alpha} \cdot \mathbf{p} + 
               \beta m c^2 - \frac{Ze^2}{4 \pi \epsilon_0 r}
        \right] \psi = E \psi
    \end{displaymath}
    where $\psi$ is a 4-component spinor.
    The Dirac equation takes special relativistic effects and the spin of the electron
    (or any spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particle) into account, and gives the following solutions for the energy
    eigenvalues for hydrogenic atoms.
    \begin{displaymath}
        E_{nj}^{Dirac} = \frac{mc^2}
        {
            \sqrt
            { 
                1 + \frac{(Z \alpha)^2}
                {
                    n - j - \frac{1}{2} +
                    \sqrt
                    {
                        \left(j + \frac{1}{2}\right)^2 - (Z \alpha)^2
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    \end{displaymath}
    Expanding the above equation in a series we obtain
    \begin{displaymath}
        E = mc^2 \left[ 
            1 - \frac{(Z\alpha)^2}{2n^2} - \frac{(Z\alpha)^4}{2n^2}
                    \left(
                        \frac{1}{j + \frac{1}{2}} - \frac{3}{4n}
                    \right)
                        - ...
                 \right]. 
    \end{displaymath}
    This can be seen to agree with the result obtained previously using the perturbation
    theory for the first few terms.

\section{Hyperfine Structure}
    Until now, the nucleus of hydrogenic atoms has been treated as a point charge.
    effectively of infinite mass. However, precise spectroscopic measurements 
    of hydrogenic atoms reveal some very small effects on the energy levels which
    cannot be explained if the nucleus is treated in this way. These effects are
    known as \emph{hyperfine effects} because they are much smaller then the fine
    structure effects predicted by the Dirac equation. The hyperfine effects can
    be grouped into two types.
    \begin{description}
        \item[Hyperfine Structure] effects give rise to splittings in energy levels
        \item[Isotope Shifts] slightly shift the energy levels and can usually be 
              detected by observing the differences between two or more 
              different isotopes.
    \end{description}
    Hyperfine structure effects arise from the electric multipole moments of the 
    nucleus which can interact with the electromagnetic field produced at the 
    nucleus by the electrons. The two main multipole moments are the magnetic 
    dipole moment associated with the spin of the nucleus and the electric quadrupole
    moment due to the departure of the spherical charge distribution in the nucleus.
    Perturbation theory can be used to determine the shift in the energy these
    two multipole effects will have.
       
    \subsection{Magnetic Dipole Interaction}
    The perturbation which describes the interaction of the nuclear magnetic dipole 
    moment consists of two expressions depending on the orbital angular momentum $l$.
    For the case of $l \neq 0$ we have
    \begin{displaymath}
        H'_{MD} = \frac{2\mu_0}{4 \pi \hbar} g_I \mu_B \mu_N \frac{1}{r^3}
                   {\bf G} \cdot {\bf I}
    \end{displaymath}
    where
    \begin{displaymath}
        {\bf G} = {\bf L} - {\bf S} + 3 \frac{({\bf S} \cdot {\bf r}) {\bf r}}{r^2}
    \end{displaymath}
    and the total spin of the atom (nucleus and electron) is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        {\bf F} = {\bf I} + {\bf J}.
    \end{displaymath}
%    This perturbation gives the following first order shift in the energy,
%    \begin{displaymath}
%        \Delta E_{MD} = \frac{C}{2} [ F(F+1) - I(I+1) - j(j+1)]
%    \end{displaymath}
%    where
%    \begin{displaymath}
%        C = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} 2g_I \mu_B \mu_N \frac{l(l+1)}{j(j+1)}
%            \frac{Z^3}{a_{\mu}^{3} n^3 l (l + l/2)(l+1)}
%    \end{displaymath}
    For the case when $l = 0$, the perturbation is given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        H'_{MD}  =  \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} 2g_I \mu_B \mu_N \frac{8 \pi}{3} 
               \delta({\bf r}) {\bf S} \cdot {\bf I}.
    \end{displaymath}

    \subsection{Electric Quadrupole Interaction}
    The interaction Hamiltonian between the electric quadrupole moment of the
    nucleus and the electrostatic potential create by an electron at the nucleus is 
    given (in atomic units) by
    \begin{displaymath}
        H'_{EQ} = B \frac{\frac{3}{2}{\bf I} \cdot {\bf J} (2{\bf I}\cdot {\bf J} + 1) - 
                        {\bf I}^2 {\bf J}^2} {2I(2I-1)j(2j-1)}    
    \end{displaymath}

    \subsection{Hyperfine Spectrum}
    The magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole interactions above correspond to 
    a total hyperfine energy shift of
    \begin{displaymath}
        \Delta E = \frac{C}{2}K + \frac{B}{4} 
                   \frac{\frac{3}{2}K(K+1)-2I(I+1)j(j+1)}{I(2I-1)j(2j-1)}
    \end{displaymath}
    where $B$ is the quadrupole coupling constant given by
    \begin{displaymath}
        B = Q \left \langle \frac{\partial^2 V}{\partial z^2} \right \rangle
    \end{displaymath}
    and
    \begin{displaymath}
        K = F(F+1) - I(I+1) - j(j+1)
    \end{displaymath}
    \begin{displaymath}
         C = \frac{\mu_0}{4\pi} 2g_I \mu_B \mu_N \frac{l(l+1)}{j(j+1)}
            \frac{Z^3}{a_{\mu}^{3} n^3 l (l + l/2)(l+1)} 
    \end{displaymath}

    The energy level diagram above shows the splittings of the different energy
    in a Hydrogen atom for n = 1 and n = 2. The diagram is not to scale and
    are magnified form the left to the right. The diagram qualitatively shows
    the effect on the Bohr/Schr\"odinger energy from the various corrections
    such as the Dirac fine structure, the Lamb Shift (described in the 
    next section) and the hyperfine structure.

    \subsection{The 21 cm Line of Atomic Hydrogen}
    The energy level splitting diagram above shows that the ground state of
    the hydrogen atom splits into two hyperfine levels with the total angular
    momentum of the atom being $F=0$ and $F=1$.
    The difference in energy between these two levels is 1420 MHz which corresponds
    to a wavelength of $\lambda \approx $ 21 cm. The probability of a transition
    occurring between these two levels is very low and occurs on average only 
    once every few million years. However, there is a large amount of hydrogen gas
    in the galaxy allowing radio telescopes easily detect this 21 cm transition and
    therefore allow the mapping of hydrogen in the galaxy.

\section{The Lamb Shift}
    Investigation of the fine structure of hydrogenic atoms using spectroscopic techniques
    in the 1930's showed that there were small differences between the observed spectra
    and the theoretical predictions made by the Dirac equation.
    For example, according to the Dirac equation the $2s_{1/2}$ and the $2p_{1/2}$ states
    coincide at the same energy level. Observations showed that the $2s_{1/2}$ was shifted 
    slightly upwards by about 0.03 cm$^{-1}$.
    A very accurate measurement of the shift was made in 1947 by Lamb and Retherford using
    microwave techniques to stimulate a direct radio-frequency transition between the 
    $2s_{1/2}$ and the $2p_{1/2}$ levels. This small shift of energy levels became known
    as the Lamb shift.

    The physics of the Lamb shift are described in the theory of quantum electrodynamics,
    in which radiative corrections to the Dirac equation are obtained by taking into
    account the interaction of a quantised electromagnetic field with an electron.
    The Lamb shift arises because of the zero point energy of a quantised electromagnetic
    field is non zero, similar to the zero point energy of a quantum harmonic oscillator.
    In a vacuum, fluctuations of the zero point energy of the quantised radiation field
    act on the electron. The effect of the electron is to cause it to oscillate rapidly
    about some equilibrium position. As a result of this oscillatory motion, the electron
    does not appear to be point charge -- instead the electron charge is slightly smeared
    at in a sphere of some small radius. When the electron is bound by an electric field
    as it is in an atom, the potential it experiences is slightly different to that 
    experienced by the electron in it's mean position. Therefore electrons which are
    most sensitive to short distance modifications such as those in the ground state
    are raised in energy with respect to other states to which the shift is much smaller.
