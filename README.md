Atomic Physics Paper on the Spectrum and Energy Levels of Hydrogenic Atoms

I wrote this paper in April 1998 as part of a course in relativistic quantum
mechanics (Quantum Mechanics B) which I was undertaking as part of my Honours
year in Physics. 

The paper describes briefly how the different effects contribute to the energy
levels and ultimately the observed spectrum of the Hydrogen atom. However the
formulation keeps the Z as a parameter and therefore more generally this paper
is about Hydrogenic atoms. 

The paper starts off with the Schrodinger equation and builds up a description
of the phenomena which contribute to the Hydrogenic spectrum including:

* Fine Structure (due to relativistic effects and electron spin)
* The Dirac Equation (which provides the proper formalism for fine structure)
* Hyperfine Structure (due to the electric multipole moments of the nucleus)
* The Lamb Shift (due to Quantum Electrodynamic Effects)

Although the paper briefly describes the source of the Lamb Shift, it basically
stops there and does not expand on the theory or the mathematics of Quantum
Electrodynamics. 

This was an interesting paper to write because the focus of my honours research
thesis was very much on using the Dirac equation to investigate the interaction
between high energy X-rays and 1 and 2 electron atoms (such as Hydrogen and
Helium). Although the quantum mechanics of Helium or any multi-body system with
the Dirac equation is a whole other story. 

The paper is basically as it was written in 1998 without any corrections apart
from formatting. Originally the paper was compiled into DVI and then converted
to Postscript. When I found the source in my archives I reformatted it using
the IEEE article LaTeX class template, reorganised the tables and figures and
recompiled using pdflatex. Apart from these minor cosmetic changes, the content
of the paper is the same as the one I submitted in 1998 as an undergraduate.
